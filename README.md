# UFOs
### Overview of Project: 
Created a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. The table can filter data based on specific search criteria and was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. The table is fully dynamic and reacts to the user's inputs while placed into an HTML file for easy viewing. The webpage was also customized using Bootstrap, allowing the users to interact with several fully functional filters and visualizations. 
####### The purpose of the project is to allow viewers the opportunity to discover information on UFOS and review past data using filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
